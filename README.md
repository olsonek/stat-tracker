# stat-tracker

stat-tracker is an app designed to present data in a simple, yet highly customizable way.

## Motivation

As a tabletop enthusiast, I wanted a straightforward means by which I can track basic statistics about my characters without having to provide every detail about my character up front.

This app serves to enable users to track as much or as little information as they want without getting in the way.
